Two undergraduates from our lab and one recent alum traveled with me to Salt Lake City to present three poster presentations at the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) annual meeting. Taylor Garver and Kiera Kaeser presented data from our CRISPR screens to identify novel genes involved in lens development. Lab alumnus Teddy Togliatti was a co-author on a poster with our collaborator Dylan Farnsworth from the [University at Albany](https://www.albany.edu/rna/faculty/dylan-farnsworth) on single-cell RNA-seq analysis of zebrafish larvae with a disabled gene for the transcription factor *cebpg*. I presented a bulk RNA-seq analysis of our alpha crystallin mutants.

In between sessions we had the chance to hike up in the hills near the University of Utah and visit the Natural History Museum of Utah.
