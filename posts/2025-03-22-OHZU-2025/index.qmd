The third [Ohio Zebrafish Undergraduate Research Conference (OHZU)](https://ohzu.wordpress.com/) was held at Ashland University on March 22nd. I co-founded this conference in 2019 with my colleague [Sarah Petersen from Kenyon College](https://www.kenyon.edu/directory/sarah-petersen/). This year we were joined by [Monica Blatnik of Oberlin College](https://www.oberlin.edu/monica-blatnik), who will host our 4th meeting in 2027.
