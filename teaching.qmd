I teach a range of courses from **Vertebrate** and **Marine Biology** to **Cell** and **Molecular Biology**. I also teach our department's seminar course in **Professional Development**, a science-focused career development course. Here are some examples of course trips and projects.

## Vertebrate Biology
In the Spring of 2025 we visited the Columbus Zoo where we got a behind the scenes tour of the giraffes and met with Ashland University alumna and pinniped animal handler Courtney Kourie to learn about the care and training of the zoo's seals and sea lions.

## Marine Biology
This course has included a capstone trip to the Outer Banks of North Carolina:

## Cell Biology

During lab students use various imaging techniques on a variety of cell types:

## Molecular Biology

Students used a variety of techniques to genotype members of the class for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), including restriction enzyme digest, Sanger sequencing, and high resolution melt. They compared the prevalence of different genotypes in the class to proportions reported in public databases for the global population. Below is an example of a figure generated by one student to present these data:
