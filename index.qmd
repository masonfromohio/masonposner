I am a Professor in the Department of Biology/Toxicology in the College
of Arts and Sciences at Ashland University, a medium sized private
school in Ohio. My undergraduate research students and I use a small
tropical fish called the zebrafish to study the development of the
ocular lens and what can go wrong to produce cataracts, one of the
leading causes of human blindness. We use CRISPR gene editing to
discover and investigate the molecular machinery behind lens biology
with the support of funding from the National Institutes of Health. I
teach a number of courses including Marine Biology, Zoology, Cell
Biology and Molecular Biology, as well as a seminar on professional
development for science majors. I direct our Choose Ohio First
scholarship program for STEM students and developed the social media
outreach and alumni engagement for our science programs.
