    "text": "What genes regulate eye lens development?\nPrevious work from many labs have identified a number of gene required to make a healthy eye lens. Much of this work is done in mammal model species, like the mouse. Here is an excellent review of what is known about the molecular control of lens development. However, there are multiple open questions about lens development and likely many undiscovered controls on the process. We recently worked with our colleague Dylan Farnsworth at the University at Albany to publish the first atlas describing gene expression at the individual cell level during lens development for any vertebrate species. This zebrafish data showed that there are numerous genes that are highly expressed in lens cells with no currently known lens function. We are using CRISPR/Cas9 editing to damage these genes to identify novel mechanisms involved in lens development."

    "section": "How do the most abundant proteins in the lens work?",
    "text": "How do the most abundant proteins in the lens work?\nThe primary job of the lens is to focus incoming light on the retina so that we can produce clear images of our surroundings. Focusing light requires that it be bent, or refracted, much like the light passing through a camera lens. The lens produces this refraction by packing its central fiber cells with large quantities of proteins called lens crystallins. We have used zebrafish to better understand the role that these proteins play during lens development and to compare their function to the same proteins in humans. We have even compared the same lens crystallin protein in animals living in a wide range of temperatures, including the antarctic toothfish, to discover how the protein evolves to function at these temperatures.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that lens crystallins may play broader roles than simply producing the density needed for light refraction. We are currently using CRISPR-generated fish lacking two different alpha-crystallins to explore how their loss may impact developmental processes both within the lens and in other parts of the body."

    "section": "What happens as the lens ages?",
    "text": "What happens as the lens ages?\nBecause most of the cells in the lens lack nuclei they are not able to replace proteins as they age. This makes the lens an excellent model for studying protein aging in particular, and molecular aging in general. This aging is the cause of most lens cataracts, the leading cause of human blindness worldwide, and presbyopia, the inability to focus up close as we get older.\nZebrafish typically have a lifespan of 3-5 years in a research laboratory. This means that zebrafish become “middle-aged” by 3 years, allowing us to more quickly study the effects of aging."
